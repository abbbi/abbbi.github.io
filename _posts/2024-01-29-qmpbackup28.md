title: qmpbackup 0.28
---

Over the last weekend i had some spare time to improve
[qmpbackup](https://github.com/abbbi/qmpbackup) a little more, the new version:

 * Uses `blockdev-backup` QMP commands instead of the soon to be deprecated
   `drive-backup`.
 * Adds `--compress` option: target QCOW files data can be compressed.
 * Adds `--speed-limit` option to limit backup speed throughput.
 * Adds `--include-raw` option so attached raw devices can be backed up
 too.
 * Improved logging output.

and some minor code reworks. Hope its useful for someone.
