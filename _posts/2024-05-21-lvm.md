title: lvm thin send/recv
---

A few days ago i found [this
mail](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cc8394d86f045b86ff303d3c9e4ce47d97148951)
on the LKML that introduces support for userspace access to LVM thin
provisioned metadata snapshots. I didn't know this is possible.

Using the [thin provisioning
tools](https://github.com/jthornber/thin-provisioning-tools) you can then
export the metadata information for your LVM snapshots to track changed regions
between them.

The workflow is pretty straight forward, yet not really documented:

 * Create a base snapshot for a volume on a thin provisioned LVM pool, this
   snapshot is used as reference for further incremental snapshots:

{% highlight bash %}
# lvcreate -ay -Ky --snapshot -n full_backup thingroup/vol1
{% endhighlight %}

 * Now copy some data to the volume and create another snapshot, additionally
   tell the kernel to create a metadata snapshot using `dmsetup`.

{% highlight bash %}
  # dmsetup message /dev/mapper/thingroup-thinpool-tpool 0 reserve_metadata_snap
  # lvcreate -ay -Ky --snapshot -n inc_backup thingroup/vol1
{% endhighlight %}

 * Export an XML description of the differences between the snapshots using the
   `thin_delta` executable and release the snapshot:

{% highlight bash %}
  # thin_delta  -m --snap1 $(lvs --noheadings -o thin_id thingroup/full_backup) --snap2 $(lvs --noheadings -o thin_id thingroup/inc_backup) > delta_dump
  # dmsetup message /dev/mapper/thingroup-thinpool-tpool 0 release_metadata_snap
{% endhighlight %}

 * Parse the resulting XML file and read the blocks reported as "different" and
   "right only" from the created data snapshot.

This all has already been implemented by a nice utility called
[thin-send-recv](https://github.com/LINBIT/thin-send-recv), which based on this
functionality allows to (incrementally) send LVM snapshots to remote systems
just like `zfs send or zfs recv.`
