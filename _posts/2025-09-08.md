title: Vagrant images for trixie
---

It's no news that the vagrant license has changed while ago, which resulted
in less motivation to maintain it in Debian (understandably).

One downside is that there are currently no official vagrant images for Debian
trixie. [See also](https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg2049694.html)

Of course there are various boxes floating around at hashicorp's vagrant cloud,
but either they do not fit my needs (too big) or i don't find them trustworthy
enough... 

Building the images using the existing toolset is quite straight forward. The code
and scripts are maintained in the [Debian Vagrant
images](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debian-vagrant-images) repository.

With [a few additional changes applied](https://salsa.debian.org/cloud-team/debian-vagrant-images/-/merge_requests/18)
and following the instructions of the README, you can build the images yourself.

For me, they work like expected.
