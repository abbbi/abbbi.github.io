title: small standalone sshds in go
---

Been looking into some existant sshd implementations in go. Most of the
projects on github seem to use the standard x/crypto/ssh lib.

During testing, i just wanted to see which banner these kind of ssh servers
provide, using the simple command:

{% highlight bash %}
 nc localhost <port>
{% endhighlight %}

And noticed that at least some of these "sshds" did not accept any further
connection. Simple DoS via netcat, nice.

Until this day, [the Golang documentation is missing some crucial hint that the
function handling the connection should be called as
goroutine](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43521), otherwise it simply
blocks any further incoming connections.

Created some pull requests on the most starred projects i found, seems even
experienced golang devs missed this part.
