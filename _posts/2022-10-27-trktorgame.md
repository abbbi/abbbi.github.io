title: fun with pygame
---

Next year my son will turn 4. I have quit playing computer games for a pretty
long time now, but recently i questioned myself: what will be the first
computer game hes going to play? Why not create a simple game by myself?

Living on the landside, his attention has been drawn to farming machines
for quite some time now and that topic never grows old for him, which 
makes for a perfect game setting.

The game logic should be pretty simple: A tiling 2d jump game where you have to
make an tractor jump over appearing objects. Different vehicles and backgrounds
to choose and a set of "lives" with randomly generated "coins" which you have
to catch to undo happened failures.

Never having done anything related to pygame the learning curve has been quite
good so far :-)

The part i spent most time with was searching for free assets and pixel art
which im able to use. Gimp also made me lose quite some hair while failing to
canvas/crop images to the right size so the placements within the different
maps matched.. 

I used pyinstaller to make it somewhat portable (needs to run on windows too)
and building the artifacts using github actions was quite a nice experience..
Lets see where this goes next, lots of ideas come to my mind :)
