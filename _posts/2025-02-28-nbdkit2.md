title: proxmox backup nbdkit plugin round 2
---

I re-implemented the [proxmox backup nbdkit
plugin](https://abbbi.github.io/nbdkit-pbs/) in C.

It seems golang shared libraries [don't play
well](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15538) with programs that fork().

As a result, the Plugin was only usable if nbdkit were run in foreground mode
(-f), making it impossible to use nbdkit's' captive modes, which are quite
useful..  Lessons learned.

[Here is the C version](https://github.com/abbbi/cpbsnbd)
