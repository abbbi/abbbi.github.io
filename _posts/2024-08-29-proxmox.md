title: proxmox backup S3 proxy
---

A few weeks ago [Tiziano Bacocco](https://github.com/tizbac) started a small
project to implement a (golang) proxy that allows to store proxmox backups on
S3 compatible storage:
[pmoxs3backuproxy](https://github.com/tizbac/pmoxs3backuproxy), a feature which
the current backup server does not have.

I wanted to have a look at the Proxmox Backup Server implementation for a
while, so i jumped on the wagon and helped with adding most of the [API
endpoints](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/api-viewer/index.html) required to
seamlessly use it as drop-in replacement in PVE.

The current version can be configured as storage backend in PVE. You can then
schedule your backups to the S3 storage likewise.

It now supports both the [Fixed index
format](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/file-formats.html#fixed-index-format-fidx)
required to create virtual machine backups and the [Dynamic index format](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/file-formats.html#dynamic-index-format-didx),
used by the regular proxmox-backup-client for file and container backups.

The other endpoints like adding notes, removing or protecting backups, mounting
images using the PVE frontend (or proxmox-backup-client) work too. It comes
with a garbage collector that does prune the backup storage if snapshots expire
and runs integrity checks on the data.

You can also configure it as so called "remote" storage in the Proxmox Backup
server itself and pull back complete buckets using "proxmox-backup-manager
pull", if your local datastore crashes.

I think it will become more interesting if future proxmox versions will
allow to [push backups](https://bugzilla.proxmox.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3044) to other
stores, too.
