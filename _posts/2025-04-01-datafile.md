title: libvirt - incremental backups for raw devices
---

Skimming through the latest libvirt releases, to my suprise, i found that
recent libvirt versions (>= v10.10.0) have added support for the QCOW data-file
setting.

Usually the incremental backup feature using bitmaps was limited to qcow2 based
images, as there was no way to store the bitmaps persistently within raw
devices. This basically ruled out proper incremental backups for direct
attached luns, etc.

[In the
past](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-03/msg07448.html),
there were some discussions how to implement this, mostly by using a separate
metadata qcow image, holding the bitmap information persistently.

These approaches have been picked up lately again [and have been
implemented](https://patchew.org/Libvirt/20241120155229.1259-1-nikolai.barybin@virtuozzo.com/)

In order to be able to use the feature, however, you need to configure the
virtual machines an its disks a special way:

Lets assume you have a virtual machine that uses a raw device
`/tmp/datafile.raw`

1) Create an qcow image:

{% highlight bash %}
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/metadata.qcow2 ..
{% endhighlight %}

2) Now use the amend option to point the qcow image to the raw device using the
   data-file option:

{% highlight bash %}
 qemu-img amend /tmp/metadata.qcow2 -o data_file=/tmp/datafile.raw,data_file_raw=true
{% endhighlight %}

3) Reconfigure the virtual machine configuration to look like this:

{% highlight bash %}
    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
      <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' cache='none' io='native' discard='unmap'/>
      <source file='/tmp/metadata.qcow2'>
        <dataStore type='file'>
          <format type='raw'/>
          <source file='/tmp/datafile.raw'/>
        </dataStore>
      </source>
      <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
    </disk>
{% endhighlight %}

Now its possible to create persistent checkpoints:

{% highlight bash %}
 virsh checkpoint-create-as vm6 --name test --diskspec vda,bitmap=test
 Domain checkpoint test created
{% endhighlight %}

and the persistent bitmap will be stored within the metadata image:

{% highlight bash %}
 qemu-img info  /tmp/tmp.16TRBzeeQn/vm6-sda.qcow2
 [..]
    bitmaps:
        [0]:
            flags:
                [0]: auto
            name: test
            granularity: 65536
{% endhighlight %}

Hoooray.

Now, i need to find some time to [implement a proper solution into
virtnbdbackup](https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup/issues/261) to correctly
handle these situations.
