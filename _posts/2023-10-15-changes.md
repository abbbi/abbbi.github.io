title: Testing system updates using libvirts checkpoint feature
---

If you want to test upgrades on virtual machines (running on libvit/qemu/kvm)
these are usually the most common steps:

 * Clone the virtual machine and test the upgrade.
 * Create a snapshot beforehand, do an in-place upgrade and hope everything
   works. If not, revert the snapshot..
 * Combine both methods
 * Use LVM or filesystem snapshots (snapper, etc)

As with recent versions, both libvirt and qemu have full support for dirty
bitmaps (so called checkpoints). These checkpoints, once existent, will track
changes to the block level layer and can be exported via NBD protocol.

Usually one can create these checkpoints using `virsh checkpoint-create[-as]`,
with a proper [xml description.](https://libvirt.org/formatbackup.html)

Using the pull based model, the following is possible:

 * Issue an backup-begin statement and freeze the virtual machines file
   systems during this process (using qemu-agent) so you get an consistent
   system state.
 * Create an qcow2 image with backing image option that points to the created
   (readonly) NBD export via unix socket as overlay.
 * Use the created overlay image to boot up the instance and test the system
   upgrade.
 * Do so while the virtual machine is operating without any downtime.

The overlay image will only use the disk space for the blocks changed during
upgrade: no need to create a full clone which may waste a lot of disk space.

In order to simplify the first step, its possible to use
[virtnbdbackup](https://github.com/abbbi/virtnbdbackup) for creating the
required consistent checkpoint and export its data using a unix domain socket.

Update: As alternative, ive just created a small utility called
[vircpt](https://github.com/abbbi/vircpt) to create and export checkpoints.

In my example im using a debian11 virtual machine with qemu guest agent
configured:

{% highlight bash %}
# virsh list --all
 Id Name State 
 ------------------------------------------ 
 1 debian11_default running
{% endhighlight %}

Now let virtnbdbackup create an checkpoint, freeze the filesystems during
creation and tell libvirt to provide us with a usable NBD server listening on
an unix socket:

{% highlight bash %}
# virtnbdbackup -d debian11_default -o /tmp/foo -s
INFO lib common - printVersion [MainThread]: Version: 1.9.45 Arguments: ./virtnbdbackup -d debian11_default -o /tmp/foo -s
[..] 
INFO root virtnbdbackup - main [MainThread]: Local NBD Endpoint socket: [/var/tmp/virtnbdbackup.5727] 
INFO root virtnbdbackup - startBackupJob [MainThread]: Starting backup job.
INFO fs fs - freeze [MainThread]: Freezed [2] filesystems. 
INFO fs fs - thaw [MainThread]: Thawed [2] filesystems. 
INFO root virtnbdbackup - main [MainThread]: Started backup job for debugging, exiting.
{% endhighlight %}

We can now use nbdinfo to display some information about the NBD export:

{% highlight bash %}
# nbdinfo "nbd+unix:///vda?socket=/var/tmp/virtnbdbackup.5727" 
    protocol: newstyle-fixed without TLS, using structured packets 
    export="vda": 
    export-size: 137438953472 (128G) 
    content: 
        DOS/MBR boot sector uri: nbd+unix:///vda?socket=/var/tmp/virtnbdbackup.5727
{% endhighlight %}

And create a backing image that we can use to test an in-place upgrade:

{% highlight bash %}
# qemu-img create -F raw -b nbd+unix:///vda?socket=/var/tmp/virtnbdbackup.5727 -f qcow2 upgrade.qcow2
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have various ways for booting the image:

 * Create another domain config in libvirt which points to this disk image,
   boot.
 * Extract the current qemu command line for the the running domain using
   `virsh domxml-to-native qemu-argv --domain debian11_default` and execute it
   manually after adjusting required parameters. 
 * Trust for everything to work out in the simplest way and simply boot up the
   image via:

{% highlight bash %}
# qemu-system-x86_64 -hda upgrade.qcow2 -m 2500 --enable-kvm
{% endhighlight %}

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abbbi/abbbi.github.io/master/images/upgrade.jpg)

After performing the required tests within the virtual machine we can simply
kill the active NBD "backup job":

{% highlight bash %}
# virtnbdbackup -d debian11_default -o /tmp/foo -k
INFO lib common - printVersion [MainThread]: Version: 1.9.45 Arguments: ./virtnbdbackup -d debian11_default -o /tmp/foo -k 
[..]
INFO root virtnbdbackup - main [MainThread]: Stopping backup job
{% endhighlight %}

And remove the created qcow image:

{% highlight bash %}
# rm -f upgrade.qcow2
{% endhighlight %}
