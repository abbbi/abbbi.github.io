title: Vagrant images for trixie
---

It's no news that the vagrant license has changed while ago, which resulted
in less motivation to maintain it in Debian (understandably).

Unfortunately this means there are currently no official vagrant images for Debian
trixie, [for reasons](https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg2049694.html)

Of course there are various boxes floating around on hashicorp's vagrant cloud,
but either they do not fit my needs (too big) or i don't consider them trustworthy
enough...

Building the images using the existing toolset is quite straight forward. The
required scripts are maintained in the [Debian Vagrant
images](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debian-vagrant-images) repository.

With [a few additional changes applied](https://salsa.debian.org/cloud-team/debian-vagrant-images/-/merge_requests/18)
and following the instructions of the README, you can build the images yourself.

For me, the built images work like expected.
