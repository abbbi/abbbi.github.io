title: tracking changes between pypi package releases
---

I wondered if there is some tracking for differences between packages
published on pypi, something that stores this information in a format
similar to debdiff..

I failed to find something on the web, so created a little utility which
watches the pypi
[changelog](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/xml-rpc.html) for new
releaes and fetches the new and old version.

It uses diffoscope to create reports on the published releases and
automatically pushes them to a github repository:

 [https://github.com/pypi-diff](https://github.com/pypi-diff)
 
Is it useful? I dont know, it may be handy for code review or maybe running
different security scanners on it, to identify accidentaly pushed keys or other
sensitive data.

Currently its pushing the changes for every released package every 10 minutes,
lets see how far this can go just for fun :-)
